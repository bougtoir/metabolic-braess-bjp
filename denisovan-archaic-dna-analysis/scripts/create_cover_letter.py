     '"Archaic Introgression Sharing as a Tracer of Ancient Human Migration: '
     'A Bivariate Approach Using Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA Signatures" '
     'for consideration as a Hypotheses article in BioEssays.'),

    ('This manuscript proposes that pairwise correlations of archaic '
     'introgression frequency profiles between human populations can serve '
     'as an independent tracer of past long-distance migration. Using publicly '
     'available hmmix introgression segments from 3,134 individuals across '
     '66 populations (1000 Genomes + HGDP), we demonstrate that a multiple '
     'regression model incorporating geographic distance, recent admixture '
     'proportions, and continental grouping explains over 50% of the variance '
     'in both Neanderthal and Denisovan sharing correlations. We identify '
     'two key geographic signatures: a sharp Denisovan boundary at the Wallace '
     'Line and Neanderthal sharing residuals consistent with Beringian migration.'),

    ('Our work extends beyond the recent study by Quilodr\u00e1n et al. (Sci Adv, '
     '2023) in three important ways: (1) we jointly analyze both Neanderthal '
     'and Denisovan introgression as complementary tracers; (2) we operate at '
     'the level of segment sharing rather than aggregate ancestry proportions; '
     'and (3) we explicitly model and correct for confounding factors including '
     'recent admixture in American populations and shared continental ancestry. '
     'We also provide four specific, testable predictions for validation with '
     'forthcoming ancient genome data.'),

    ('We believe this hypothesis-driven manuscript is well suited to the '
     'Hypotheses format of BioEssays, as it proposes a novel conceptual '
     'framework supported by reanalysis of existing public data, without '
     'requiring original experimental work. The bivariate approach we outline '
     'opens new avenues for using archaic DNA as an independent line of '
     'evidence in reconstructing human migration history.'),

    ('All analysis code and derived data are publicly available on GitHub. '
     'The manuscript has not been published previously and is not under '
     'consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the submission.'),
