# Discharged Secrets

## Current revision track

The project is an empirical, reproducible package: a PRISMA-ScR scoping review, a global field audit of public GBFS vehicle feeds, and a structured disclosure audit of public operator privacy notices. It was first prepared for *Computers & Security* (Elsevier); after desk rejection for scope mismatch it was reformatted for *Data & Policy* (Cambridge University Press) and, following a desk rejection there, was reformatted for **Transport Policy** (Elsevier), then for *Research in Transportation Business & Management* (Elsevier; desk-rejected for limited transport impact), and is now being prepared for **Transport Economics and Management** (Elsevier, open access) as a Research article — numbered references in order of first appearance, 3-5 highlights, ≤6 keywords, double-anonymized peer review, a concise abstract, and the journal's required declarations. The revision reframes the study for a transport-economics and management audience (principal-agent information asymmetry, concession design, procurement monitoring). `REVIEWER_REVIEW.md` records the pre-submission reviewer-perspective assessment and residual caveats.

- `PROTOCOL.md`: prospective study protocol;
- `REVISION_STRATEGY.md`: article redesign and claim boundaries;
- `REVIEWER_REVIEW.md`: critical reviewer-perspective review performed before finalization;
- `review/`: open-metadata searches, screening codebook, candidate corpus, abstract retrieval, screening, extraction, and document retrieval;
- `audit/`: GBFS collection, aggregation, document coding, and framework-traceability tools;
- `data/`: frozen GBFS registry, privacy-preserving cross-sectional observations, and coded document audit;
- `results/`: aggregate audit results.

### Rebuild the bibliographic candidate corpus

```bash
python review/search_open_metadata.py \
  --config review/search_queries.json \
  --output review/candidates.csv \
  --log review/search_log.csv

python review/initialize_screening.py \
  --candidates review/candidates.csv \
  --seeds review/direct_evidence_seeds.csv \
  --output review/screening.csv

python review/validate_screening.py \
  --screening review/screening.csv
```

Abstracts, deterministic screening, and study-level extraction are then produced by:

```bash
python review/fetch_abstracts.py      # OpenAlex abstracts -> review/.abstract_cache.csv (git-ignored)
python review/screen_records.py       # deterministic title/abstract + full-text decisions
python review/build_extraction.py     # 18-study extraction -> review/evidence_extraction.csv
```

### Rebuild the GBFS cross-sectional audit

```bash
python audit/gbfs_cross_sectional_audit.py \
  --registry-output data/gbfs_registry.csv \
  --audit-output data/gbfs_cross_sectional_audit.csv \
  --metadata-output data/gbfs_audit_metadata.csv

python audit/summarize_gbfs_audit.py \
  --audit data/gbfs_cross_sectional_audit.csv \
  --summary-csv results/gbfs_summary.csv \
  --operator-csv results/gbfs_operator_summary.csv \
  --summary-md results/gbfs_preliminary_summary.md

python audit/select_operator_sample.py \
  --operator-summary results/gbfs_operator_summary.csv \
  --output audit/operator_sample.csv
```

### Rebuild the public-document disclosure audit

```bash
python review/fetch_documents.py      # cache operator privacy notices under review/.doc_cache/ (git-ignored)
python audit/code_documents.py        # deterministic 14-domain coding -> data/document_audit.csv
```

Document coding is computer-assisted and single-reviewer. `not_found` denotes silence in a document, not evidence that a practice is absent; every coding carries a short verbatim locator quotation. Full document bodies are never committed.

The audit never writes raw vehicle identifiers, coordinates, or deep links. Field-presence results are aggregate observations at the registered-system level. The outputs do not establish trip reconstruction, identifier-rotation nonconformity, hidden backend collection, compromise, or operator intent.

## Reproduce the results

Every count, proportion, confidence interval, figure, and table reported in the article is regenerated from the committed public data (`data/`, `results/`, `review/`) with a single command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python reproduce.py
```

This writes to `output/`:

- five figures (`figures/Figure1-5.png`, `.tiff`, `.pdf` at 600 dpi);
- an editable `Figures_TEM_editable.pptx` (one figure per slide);
- editable tables (`Tables_TEM_editable.docx`), with in-table citation numbers taken from the committed `results/citation_order.json` so they match the article; and
- `reproducibility_values.json` — every in-text count, proportion, and 95% Wilson confidence interval, plus the full GBFS and disclosure-audit summaries, so the article's numbers can be verified directly against the data.

The upstream data pipeline (screening, GBFS field audit, disclosure coding) is documented in the sections above and regenerates `results/*.csv` and `data/*.csv` from the frozen inputs.

### Scope of this repository

This repository contains the data, the analysis code, and the figure-, table-, and number-generation code so that readers can reproduce the results independently. The manuscript-body, cover-letter, and title-page **generation script is intentionally not included here**: it carries the article prose and does not contribute to result reproducibility.

**Zenodo deposit (mint the DOI):** enable the repository under Zenodo → Settings → GitHub, create a GitHub Release; Zenodo archives the tagged snapshot and mints a DOI. `.zenodo.json` and `CITATION.cff` in this directory seed the archive metadata. Cite the **concept DOI** so the statement never needs updating across versions.

## Manuscript validation (in the non-public assembler)

The manuscript assembler (not distributed here) fails the build if:

- any in-text citation does not resolve to a reference, or a reference is uncited (no orphan/phantom references);
- the reference list is not alphabetised by author;
- an unresolved `[[...]]` citation marker leaks into the rendered text;
- a figure or table is absent from the manuscript text;
- the abstract exceeds 250 words;
- highlights exceed 85 characters or the keyword count exceeds 7;
- more than five keywords are supplied;
- a required disclosure statement (data availability, funding, competing interests) is missing;
- `BLINDED=1` but an author-identifying token still reaches the disclosures;
- all five figures or five tables are not present and cited; or
- an undefined abbreviation is detected from the configured abbreviation list.

The review component is reported in line with PRISMA-ScR. The study analyses only publicly accessible feeds and documents; it does not report human-participant research, so CONSORT and STROBE are not applicable.
