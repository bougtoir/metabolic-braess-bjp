    "Interrupted time series analysis with segmented regression, cross-correlation "
    "analysis for lead time estimation, and Akaike information criterion (AIC)-based "
    "model selection for window period estimation. Reporting follows the REporting of "
    "studies Conducted using Observational Routinely-collected health Data (RECORD) guidelines.")

add_abstract_field("Setting:",
    "Japan, using national administrative databases.")

add_abstract_field("Participants:",
    "Physician workforce data from the National Survey of Physicians, Dentists, and "
    "Pharmacists (1994\u20132022, biennial); healthcare facility data from the Survey of "
    "Medical Institutions (2002\u20132024); specialist trainee data from the Japan Board of "
    "Medical Specialties (2018\u20132025). Twelve core medical specialties were analysed.")

add_abstract_field("Main outcome measures:",
    "Specialty-specific physician counts, healthcare facility counts, and new specialist "
    "trainee enrolment. The main exposure variables were medical safety incident counts "
    "derived from three definitions: (1) the Japan Medical Safety Research Organisation "
    "(JMSR) mandatory reporting system (2015\u20132025); (2) medical malpractice litigation "
    "statistics from the Supreme Court of Japan (2004\u20132023); and (3) a composite index "
    "combining both sources.")

add_abstract_field("Results:",
    "In cross-correlation analysis after detrending, obstetrics and gynaecology showed "
    "the strongest inverse association between incident reports and physician numbers "
    "across all three definitions (r=\u22120.95, lag +3 years). Additional specialties "
    "demonstrating strong delayed inverse associations (|r|>0.9) included otolaryngology "

    "The relationship between medical safety incidents and physician workforce dynamics "
    "is of growing importance to health systems worldwide. Concerns that malpractice risk "
    "drives physicians away from high-risk specialties have been raised for decades,{1-3} "
    "yet quantitative evidence remains limited, geographically concentrated in the United "
    "States, and largely focused on tort reform rather than incident occurrence itself.{4-6}",

    "Japan provides a particularly informative setting for studying this phenomenon. In "
    "2004, an obstetrician at Fukushima Prefectural Ohno Hospital was arrested following "
    "a maternal death during caesarean section, and subsequently prosecuted in 2006 for "
    "professional negligence causing death.{7} Although the physician was acquitted in 2008, "
    "the case precipitated widespread concern among physicians and is widely regarded as a "
    "catalyst for the subsequent decline in obstetricians willing to provide delivery "
    "services.{8,9} Morita estimated a 13% decrease in obstetricians in the affected "
    "prefecture using difference-in-differences and synthetic control methods.{10} However, "
    "this analysis was limited to a single event, a single specialty, and a single "
    "geographic area.",

    "Japan\u2019s healthcare system features two national-level data sources on medical safety "
    "incidents. First, the Japan Medical Safety Research Organisation (JMSR; Iryo Anzen "
    "Chosa Kiko) was established in 2015 under a revision to the Medical Care Act, creating "
    "a mandatory reporting system for unexpected deaths potentially related to medical "
    "care.{11} Second, the Supreme Court of Japan publishes annual statistics on medical "
    "malpractice litigation by specialty.{12,13} Additionally, Japan conducts biennial national "
    "surveys of all practising physicians and maintains annual records of healthcare facility "
    "registrations by specialty\u2014providing unusually detailed, population-level workforce data.",

    "We aimed to quantify the temporal association between medical safety incidents and "
    "changes in specialty-specific physician counts, healthcare facility numbers, and "
    "specialist trainee enrolment, and to estimate the lead time and duration of these "
    "associations to inform workforce planning.",

add_heading_bmj("Principal findings", level=2)
add_para(
    "This study provides the first systematic, multi-specialty analysis of the temporal "
    "association between medical safety incidents and physician workforce dynamics. Using "
    "three complementary incident definitions and national administrative data from Japan, "
    "we found that incident reports are followed by reductions in specialty-specific "
    "physician supply, with an estimated lead time of 1\u20133 years and an effect duration "
    "(window period) of 4\u20135 years. Obstetrics and gynaecology showed the most consistent "
    "and strongest associations, corroborating previous findings from the Fukushima "
    "prosecution case,{10,26} but extending these to a national, multi-definition framework."
)

add_heading_bmj("Comparison with existing literature", level=2)
add_para(
    "The magnitude and direction of the association we observed for obstetrics and "
    "gynaecology is consistent with Morita\u2019s finding of a 13% decrease in obstetricians "
    "following the 2006 prosecution,{10} and with the broader literature on "
    "malpractice-driven specialty avoidance.{1-3} Studdert and colleagues reported that "
    "42% of physicians in high-risk specialties had restricted their practice in response "
    "to malpractice concerns,{1} and Klick and Stratmann found that tort reforms increased "
    "the supply of physicians in high-risk specialties.{4,27,28}"
)
add_para(
    "However, the present study extends this literature in several important ways. First, "
    "we simultaneously analysed 12 specialties, revealing that the phenomenon is not limited "
    "to obstetrics. The strong inverse associations observed for otolaryngology (r=\u22120.97), "
    "dermatology (r=\u22120.99), and urology (r=\u22120.94)\u2014specialties not traditionally considered "
    "\u201chigh-risk\u201d for malpractice\u2014suggest that the workforce impact of safety incidents may "
    "be more widespread than previously recognised. Second, the explicit estimation of lead "
    "time and window period parameters is novel, and provides actionable inputs for workforce "
    "forecasting models. Third, the use of three complementary incident definitions (mandatory "
    "safety reporting, litigation, and composite) strengthens the triangulation of findings."
)
add_para(
    "The near-zero lag observed for facility counts, compared with the 1\u20133 year lag for "
    "physician counts, has a plausible mechanistic interpretation: facility closure or "
    "de-registration of a specialty is a more proximate and binary event (a decision to stop "
    "providing a service) than the gradual attrition of physicians from a specialty through "
    "retirement, career change, or reduced recruitment."
)

add_heading_bmj("Interpretation of segmented regression coefficients", level=2)
add_para(
    "The positive incident effect coefficients observed in the ITS segmented regression "
    "models (table 2) require careful interpretation. These do not indicate that more "
    "incidents cause more physicians; rather, they reflect the challenge of disentangling "
    "contemporaneous trends in a setting where both incident reporting volume (increasing "
    "as the JMSR system matured after 2015) and physician counts for some specialties "
    "(driven by secular workforce expansion) were simultaneously increasing. The "
    "cross-correlation analysis, which removes linear trends before computing correlations "
    "at various lags, provides a more appropriate test of the hypothesised delayed inverse "
    "association and yielded results consistent with the expected direction. Future analyses "
    "using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models with transfer functions, "
    "or incorporating exogenous covariates for system maturation, may better address this "
    "limitation."
)

add_heading_bmj("Directionality of causation: interpreting negative lag values", level=2)
add_para(
    "The cross-correlation analysis revealed that several specialty-definition combinations "
    "yielded negative lag values (table 1). A negative lag indicates that the workforce "
    "outcome variable changed before the incident variable\u2014that is, physician or trainee "
    "numbers declined before incident reports increased. This finding is important because "
    "it is consistent with a reverse causal pathway: workforce depletion may itself be a "
    "driver of safety incidents, rather than (or in addition to) incidents driving workforce "
    "decline."
)
add_para(
    "Anaesthesiology is a notable example. The \u22124 year lag against the composite incident "
    "definition (r = \u22120.959) suggests that reductions in the anaesthesiology workforce may "
    "have preceded the subsequent increase in reported incidents. This is mechanistically "
    "plausible: understaffed departments face higher per-physician caseloads, fatigue, and "
    "reduced supervision of trainees, all of which are established risk factors for adverse "
    "events.{25,27} Similarly, the \u22123 year lag for otolaryngology trainees implies that "
    "declining trainee enrolment preceded rather than followed incident reports."
)
add_para(
    "These findings suggest a potentially bidirectional relationship between safety incidents "
    "and workforce dynamics. For specialties with positive lags (e.g. obstetrics and "
    "gynaecology, +3 years), the temporal sequence is consistent with the hypothesised "
    "\u2018incident \u2192 avoidance\u2019 pathway: high-profile incidents deter entry and accelerate "
    "exit, leading to workforce contraction after a delay. For specialties with negative "
    "lags, the reverse pathway\u2014\u2018workforce shortage \u2192 overwork \u2192 increased incidents\u2019\u2014"
    "may be operative. A vicious cycle in which both pathways reinforce each other is also "
    "plausible: workforce shortages lead to more incidents, which further deter recruitment, "
    "leading to further shortages."
)
add_para(
    "Distinguishing these pathways has direct policy implications. If the dominant direction "
    "is incident \u2192 avoidance, interventions should focus on improving public perception and "
    "professional support after incidents. If the dominant direction is shortage \u2192 incidents, "
    "workforce augmentation and workload reduction become the priority. The coexistence of "
    "both positive and negative lags across specialties in our data suggests that both "
    "mechanisms may be active, and that the relative importance may vary by specialty context."
)

add_heading_bmj("Strengths and limitations", level=2)
add_para(
    "Strengths: This study uses population-level data from mandatory national registries, "
    "eliminating selection bias in outcome ascertainment. The analysis covers 12 specialties "
    "with three incident definitions over periods of up to 20 years, providing a comprehensive "
    "view. The explicit estimation of lead time and window period parameters is methodologically "
    "novel and practically useful for workforce planning."
)
add_para(
    "Limitations: Several important limitations should be acknowledged. First, the JMSR data "
    "series begins in 2015, providing only 11 annual data points\u2014below the recommended "
    "minimum of approximately 12 pre-intervention and 12 post-intervention time points for "
    "ITS analysis.{16} The litigation series, while longer (2004\u20132023), has its own "
    "limitations in coverage. Second, the biennial physician survey data required linear "
    "interpolation to annual values, which may smooth short-term fluctuations. Third, the "
    "ITS segmented regression approach assumes that the intervention (peak incident year) "
    "is exogenous and discrete, whereas in reality, incident reporting is continuous and "
    "endogenous to system-level changes (such as the establishment of the JMSR itself). "
    "Fourth, we cannot establish causality. The observation of both positive and negative "
    "lag values across specialties indicates that the causal direction may not be uniform, "
    "and unmeasured confounders\u2014including demographic shifts, changes in medical school "
    "capacity, remuneration differentials, lifestyle preferences, and policy interventions "
    "such as the 2004 introduction of the new postgraduate clinical training system\u2014may "
    "explain some or all of the observed associations. Fifth, the positive direction of the "
    "contemporaneous regression coefficients highlights the difficulty of separating the "
    "incident signal from secular trends in a relatively short time series. Sixth, the "
    "specialist trainee data cover only 2018\u20132025 (8 years), severely limiting statistical "
    "power for this outcome."
)

add_heading_bmj("Policy implications", level=2)
add_para(
    "Despite these limitations, our findings have practical implications for workforce "
    "planning. The estimated lead time of 1\u20133 years suggests a window of opportunity for "
    "policy intervention between the occurrence of a high-profile safety incident and its "
    "downstream workforce effects. The estimated window period of 4\u20135 years indicates that "
    "effects are not permanent but may persist long enough to cause meaningful service "
    "disruption, particularly in specialties already experiencing workforce contraction "
    "(general surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology). Systems that can monitor incident "
    "reporting trends in near-real time could use these parameters to anticipate and "
    "mitigate workforce disruptions through targeted recruitment incentives, workload "
    "redistribution, or public communication strategies."
)
add_para(
    "The divergence between physician count trends (generally increasing or stable) and "
    "facility count trends (generally decreasing) for most specialties indicates a "
    "consolidation of care into fewer, larger facilities. This pattern has implications for "
    "geographic access to care, particularly in rural areas."
