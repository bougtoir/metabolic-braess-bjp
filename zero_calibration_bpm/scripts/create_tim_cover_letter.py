    "We are pleased to submit our original article, \u201cWhat zeroing cannot "
    "fix: detecting residual gain and dynamic-response errors after zero "
    "calibration in invasive arterial pressure monitoring,\u201d for "
    "consideration for publication in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and "
    "Measurement.")

para(
    "Zero calibration of a fluid-filled arterial pressure transducer removes "
    "the direct-current (DC) offset but cannot correct the transducer gain "
    "(sensitivity) or the frequency-dependent damping of the catheter-sensor "
    "system. We use a fully reproducible simulation, augmented with public "
    "intra-operative waveforms from the VitalDB Open Dataset, to show which "
    "statistical diagnostics actually detect a residual gain error after "
    "zeroing. Our key message is a critique of common reporting practice, not "
    "of the Bland\u2013Altman method itself: a minimal summary of mean bias and "
    "limits of agreement can miss a clinically relevant gain error when a "
    "compensating offset cancels its effect on the mean, whereas the "
    "Bland\u2013Altman regression of difference on mean, Deming and "
    "Passing\u2013Bablok regression, and the scale-shift component (v) of "
    "Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient all detect it.")

para(
    "We further integrate the dynamic-response (damping) error as a distinct, "
    "frequency-dependent gain error diagnosed by the fast-flush test, and we "
    "show that the concordance correlation coefficient is range-dependent. "
    "Because the paper is framed around measurement validity, sensor gain, "
    "uncertainty propagation and a concrete design target (v \u2248 1 without "
    "calibration) for next-generation self-calibrating pressure sensors, it is "
    "well suited to the instrumentation-and-measurement readership of IEEE TIM.")

para(
    "We submit the manuscript as an Original Article. It contains 7 inline "
    "figures and 3 inline tables, a structured abstract within the 150-250 word "
    "guideline, and a main text of approximately 3,700 words. All figures, tables, and "
    "numerical values are generated directly from the analysis pipeline so that "
    "every result can be regenerated from the public data and the supplementary "
    "code. As disclosed in the Methods, the simulation and analysis code, the "
    "figures, and drafts of the text were prepared with the assistance of an AI "
    "coding assistant (Devin; Cognition AI); the authors verified all code, "
    "results and statements and take full responsibility for the work.")

para(
    "This is a simulation and secondary-data-validation study; the synthetic "
    "data are described as such and the real waveforms come from the publicly "
    "available VitalDB Open Dataset. The manuscript is original, has not been "
    "published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors "
    "have approved the submission and declare no conflicts of interest relevant "
    "to this work. We have no preferred or excluded reviewers to suggest, but "
    "are happy to provide names on request.")
